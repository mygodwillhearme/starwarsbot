I did not write most of this code!!! I only hacked together slack’s tutorial and StephenSwat’s Edge of the Empire dice code: github.com/StephenSwat/Edge-of-the-Empire-dice. I’m only uploading it here so I can run it from the web so feel free to look but all credit goes to the people who actually made these things. Thanks!
